# gameShow

This program emulates a game show. It reads an input file that says how many contestants can be in the game, then reads other instructions from the input file including loss of points, gaining points, inserting another player, eliminating the weakest player, and crowning the winner. I've provided some example files.

## Usage

:$ make

:$ ./submission "input file" "output file"

:$ cat "output file"
